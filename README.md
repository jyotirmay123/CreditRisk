How to share notebooks with Binder:
1. Go to https://mybinder.org/.
2. Paste the repo link: https://github.com/OxnGrc/CreditRisk.git and click "launch" - this will build the notebook image, push it and make it available on JupyterHub.
3. Get the sharable link: go to File > New > Terminal, type "jupyter notebook list", get the link, replace "http://0.0.0.0:8888" with "https://hub.mybinder.org" and share with collaborator(s).
4. The session ends automatically after 10 min of inactivity.
